## Overview

### The challenge

Create a simple multiple-step form where users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- See front-end validation on inputs to proceed to subsequent steps

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

### What I learned

I have used Redux previously, however this was the first project I used Redux-toolkit. Whilst I found it challenging at the start. After I got my head around how much manual coding has been streamlined I loved it. A massive improvement on manual Redux, and I plan to use Redux-toolkit in future projects.
